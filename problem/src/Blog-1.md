Que No-1.The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript
  
1. Union Types
A union type in TypeScript allows you to define a variable that can hold values of different types. This means a variable can be one type or another, giving it more flexibility. Union types are useful when you want to allow a variable to accept multiple possible types.

Significance of Union Types:
 Flexibility: You can create variables that can accept more than one type of value, making your code more adaptable.
 Safe handling of multiple types: TypeScript ensures that all types within a union are correctly handled and provides type safety during development.
 Useful for scenarios with multiple possible data formats: Union types are particularly useful when dealing with different types of data, such as when parsing API responses that may return different shapes of data

2. Intersection Types
 An intersection type is the opposite of a union type. It combines multiple types into one. A variable of an intersection type will need to satisfy all the types combined together. This means it must have all the properties and behaviors of the types that make up the intersection.

Significance of Intersection Types:
 Combining multiple types: Intersection types are great for combining multiple types into a single, more complex type. For example, you might want to create a type that combines a Person and a Employee type, where the object must have properties of both.
 Useful for extending objects: Intersection types are useful when you need to extend an object with more properties without changing its core structure. You can merge several types into one.
